# Forward Test

Assumptions:

Data has been validated at the DB level, i.e. dates are in correct format, no missing fields etc.
If valid data cannot be guaranteed then additional error handling and FE data validation would be added but assuming this is out of scope.

## To run:

Clone repo then install packages, set node version then run dev.

```bash
npm i
nvm use
npm run dev
```

## To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
